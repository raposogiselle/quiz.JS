# talkToMeInJS
Do you speak JS? lets check!!! 

In this week assignment I am building a quiz app to test our freshly adquired JavaScript knowledge.

To play press "Let's Talk!"
Then:
    -A timer starts
    -First question will start. Must answer question in order to move to the next, an so on.
    -When a question is answered incorrectly, time is substracted form the timer (OH NO!!!) Oh yes, ;)
    -When all the questions are answered or the timer heats 0, game is over!
    -When game is over save initials and score option will follow.
